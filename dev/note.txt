BUG: 
- [X] animation size bug.
- [X] need a better game loop. current is way too fast.
	+ the problem is not the game loop. the implementation is right, just need to do it.
- [X] wrap all engine functions to a single file.
- [X] create scene system as an object.
- [] engine object to store all the engine property such as currScene, pause, draw, debug, etc.
- [] proper type checking for every parameters for better debugging.
- [] start building the game.

NOTE:
- Scene system
	+ has its own update function
	+ has its own draw function
	+ has its own input function
	+ has its own logic function
	+ in short, it has its own data uniquely to every scene
